# Comments
Only very simple and basic patterns are being identified in the notebook. <br>
I am unable to gather much insights on the datasets and also unsure of which models and algorithms could be used to derive any insights from the data. <br>
I would be grateful for any suggestions on how to use algorithms to model the data.
